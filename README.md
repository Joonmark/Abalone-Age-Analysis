## Abalone Age Data Analysis
The process of determining the age of an abalone is called sclerochronology. Similar to trees, abalones have rings on their shells. The shell is composed of calcium carbonate and proteins, and when an abalone grows, another layer forms on the outside of its shell. The specific process requires cutting the shell of the abalone through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope. To roughly determine the age of the abalone, the equation is to add 1.5 to the number of rings the abalone has, giving the age. The issue with this process however is that it is time consuming. Using other variables we can better predict its age. 

# Goal
The goal of this project is to give an example of an end to end machine learning project by leveraging machine learning methods and data analysis/inference skills. The task in this scenario is to see if it is possible to predict the age of an abalone given several features.
